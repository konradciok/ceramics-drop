# Scrollytelling

Scrollytelling is a popular technique used to create engaging and immersive web experiences. It involves animating elements on a page as the user scrolls, effectively telling a story or guiding the user through a narrative. With CSS Scroll-Driven Animations, you can create these effects directly in CSS, without needing to rely on JavaScript. The animations are controlled by the scroll position, not a time-based clock, which ensures they are always in sync with the user's scroll.

## How to implement

To create a scrollytelling experience, you need two sets of elements: one to track the scroll position and another to be animated.

First, define a named `view-timeline` on the elements you want to track. These will act as the drivers for your animations.

```css
#tracked {
  section:nth-child(1){ view-timeline: --tl-1 block; }
  section:nth-child(2){ view-timeline: --tl-2 block; }
  section:nth-child(3){ view-timeline: --tl-3 block; }
  section:nth-child(4){ view-timeline: --tl-4 block; }
  section:nth-child(5){ view-timeline: --tl-5 block; }
}
```

Next, apply animations to the elements you want to animate and link them to the timelines you just created using the `animation-timeline` property.

```css
#animated {
  section {
    animation: animate-in auto linear both, animate-out auto linear forwards;
    animation-range: entry 25% cover 50%, exit 50% exit 75%;
  }

  section:nth-child(1){ animation-timeline: --tl-1; }
  section:nth-child(2){ animation-timeline: --tl-2; }
  section:nth-child(3){ animation-timeline: --tl-3; }
  section:nth-child(4){ animation-timeline: --tl-4; }
  section:nth-child(5){ animation-timeline: --tl-5; }
}
```

For the `animation-timeline` to be able to reference the named timelines, they need to be in the same scope. You can use the `timeline-scope` property on a common ancestor to make the timelines available to all the elements that need them. The `:root` element is often a good choice for this.

```css
html {
  timeline-scope: --tl-1, --tl-2, --tl-3, --tl-4, --tl-5;
}
```

Finally, you can use the `animation-range` property to specify the exact range of the timeline during which the animation should run. This gives you fine-grained control over when the animations are triggered and how they progress.

```css
#animated section {
  animation-range: entry 25% cover 50%, exit 50% exit 75%;
}
```

## Example code

```css
html {
  timeline-scope: --tl-1, --tl-2, --tl-3, --tl-4, --tl-5;
}

#tracked {
  section:nth-child(1){ view-timeline: --tl-1 block; }
  section:nth-child(2){ view-timeline: --tl-2 block; }
  section:nth-child(3){ view-timeline: --tl-3 block; }
  section:nth-child(4){ view-timeline: --tl-4 block; }
  section:nth-child(5){ view-timeline: --tl-5 block; }
}

@keyframes animate-in {
  from { scale: 0.5; opacity: 0; transform: rotateY(-180deg); }
  to { transform: rotateY(0deg); }
}
@keyframes animate-out {
  to { translate: 100% 0; opacity: 0; }
}

#animated {
  section {
    animation: animate-in auto linear both, animate-out auto linear forwards;
    animation-range: entry 25% cover 50%, exit 50% exit 75%;
    backface-visibility: hidden;
  }

  section:nth-child(1){ animation-timeline: --tl-1; }
  section:nth-child(2){ animation-timeline: --tl-2; }
  section:nth-child(3){ animation-timeline: --tl-3; }
  section:nth-child(4){ animation-timeline: --tl-4; }
  section:nth-child(5){ animation-timeline: --tl-5; }
}

/* MANDATORY Copy-Paste Safety: Disable continuous storytelling motion for sensitive users */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  #animated section {
    animation: none !important;
    opacity: 1 !important;
    transform: none !important;
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

When using scroll-driven animations, it's important to follow a few best practices to ensure a smooth and accessible experience:

- **DO** include feature detection: Not all browsers support scroll-driven animations. Use `@supports ((animation-timeline: scroll()) and (animation-range: 0% 100%))` to check for support and provide a fallback for browsers that don't support it.
  - The `(animation-range: 0% 100%)` check **MUST** be included here, to filter out browsers with only partial support.
  - **DO NOT** use the `scroll-timeline-polyfill` package for the fallback strategy as it is not feature complete and has a lot of known issues.
  - If the animation is only considered to be decorative, opt for Progressive Enhancement and **DO NOT** provide a fallback.
- **DO** respect user preferences: Some users prefer to have less motion on the web. Use the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query to disable or reduce your animations for these users.
- **DO** try to animate only performant CSS properties: For the smoothest animations, stick to animating properties that can be handled by the browser's compositor thread, such as `transform` and `opacity`. Animating other properties like `width` or `height` can lead to performance issues.
- **DO** use the correct declaration order: When using the `animation` shorthand property, declare `animation-timeline` and `animation-range` *after* it to prevent the shorthand from resetting the timeline.

When using the `view-timeline` property to create a scroll-driven animation:

- **DO** use a CSS `<dashed-ident>` for the name.
- **OPTIONAL** be explicit about the axis to track: When not targeting the default `block` axis (such as in a horizontal scroller), be explicit about which axis to track with `view-timeline-axis`.
- **DO** make sure the scope of the lookup works: When the element that is declaring the `view-timeline` is not a flat tree ancestor of the animated element, hoist up the visibility of the `view-timeline`’s name by using `timeline-scope` on a shared ancestor.

## Fallback strategies

Scroll-driven animations has limited availability.
Supported by: Chrome 115 (Jul 2023), Edge 115 (Jul 2023), and Safari 26 (Sep 2025).
Unsupported in: Firefox.

For browsers that do not support scroll-driven animations, you can use a fallback to recreate the visual effects. The fallbacks are typically built with either a scroll listener (for ScrollTimeline effects) or the IntersectionObserver API (for ViewTimeline effects).

In browsers with built-in support for scroll-driven animations, ALWAYS use the native CSS implementation as those are more performant.

Note that not every effect can be recreated using the fallbacks approach.

For this use-case specifically, the following script applies the fallback for browsers that do not support scroll-driven animations. It uses an `IntersectionObserver` to track the visibility of each `#tracked section` element and updates the `transform` property of the corresponding `#animated section` accordingly.

```js
const animatedSections = document.querySelectorAll('#animated section');

const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
  entries.forEach(entry => {
    const sectionIndex = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('#tracked section')).indexOf(entry.target);
    if (sectionIndex !== -1) {
      const animatedSection = animatedSections[sectionIndex];
      const ratio = entry.intersectionRatio;

      // Animate-in
      animatedSection.style.opacity = ratio;
      animatedSection.style.transform = `scale(${0.5 + ratio * 0.5}) rotateY(${-180 + ratio * 180}deg)`;

      // Animate-out
      if (ratio < 0.5) {
        animatedSection.style.translate = `${(0.5 - ratio) * 2 * 100}% 0`;
      } else {
        animatedSection.style.translate = '0 0';
      }
    }
  });
}, { threshold: Array.from({length: 101}, (_, i) => i / 100) });

document.querySelectorAll('#tracked section').forEach(section => {
  observer.observe(section);
});
```

And the accompanying CSS:

```css
#animated section {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: scale(0.5)  rotateY(-180deg);
  backface-visibility: hidden;
}

/* MANDATORY Copy-Paste Safety: Ensure content remains fully visible and legible for assistive technologies or users with motion sensitivities */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  #animated section {
    opacity: 1 !important;
    transform: none !important;
    translate: 0 0 !important;
  }
}
```

This fallback provides a more accurate, scroll-driven animation for browsers that do not support the native CSS feature, ensuring a more consistent experience for all users. By using a series of thresholds for the `IntersectionObserver`, we can track the scroll position with more precision and create a smoother animation.

--- Guide for visually-texture-content ---
## Overview
To apply realistic weathering or texture patterns (like grunge, noise, or paper texture) to an element, use CSS Masking (`mask-image`) with a repeating texture image. This allows you to make the content itself appear textured by making parts of it semi-transparent, rather than just overlaying a texture on top. This creates a more realistic physical material appearance.

## Implementation
To apply a texture pattern:

### Method 1: Using a repeating raster image (Recommended for realistic textures)
This is the most common method for realistic textures.

```css
.weathered-element {
  /* MANDATORY: Use vendor prefix for wider support in older browsers */
  -webkit-mask-image: url('grunge-pattern.png');
  -webkit-mask-repeat: repeat; /* Repeat the pattern to fill the area */
  -webkit-mask-size: 300px; /* Control the scale of the texture */

  /* Standard property for modern browsers */
  mask-image: url('grunge-pattern.png');
  mask-repeat: repeat;
  mask-size: 300px;
}
```

### Method 2: Using CSS Gradients for geometric patterns
You can generate patterns using CSS gradients. This is self-contained and does not require external image files.

```css
.patterned-element {
  --checkerboard-gradient: 
    linear-gradient(45deg, #000 25%, transparent 25%), 
    linear-gradient(-45deg, #000 25%, transparent 25%), 
    linear-gradient(45deg, transparent 75%, #000 75%), 
    linear-gradient(-45deg, transparent 75%, #000 75%);

  /* Apply a checkerboard pattern as a mask */
  -webkit-mask-image: var(--checkerboard-gradient);
  -webkit-mask-size: 20px 20px;
  -webkit-mask-position: 0 0, 0 10px, 10px -10px, -10px 0px;
  
  mask-image: var(--checkerboard-gradient);
  mask-size: 20px 20px;
  mask-position: 0 0, 0 10px, 10px -10px, -10px 0px;
}
```

### Alpha vs Luminance Masking Modes

By default, CSS masks use `mask-mode: match-source`. This means the browser automatically decides whether to use the **alpha channel** (transparency) or the **luminance** (brightness) of the mask based on what kind of source you provide:

| Mask Source Type | Default Mask Mode | Masking Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inline SVG `<mask>` element** | `luminance` | Opacity is determined by the brightness of colors. **White** reveals content, **black** hides it, and **gray** creates semi-transparency. |
| **Direct Image File** (e.g. PNG, SVG file) | `alpha` | Opacity is determined by transparency. **Opaque** parts reveal content, and **transparent** parts hide it. |
| **CSS Gradient** | `alpha` | Opacity is determined by transparency. **Opaque** colors (like `black`) reveal content, and **transparent** colors hide it. |

> **Note:** You can explicitly override the default mask mode using the `mask-mode` CSS property (e.g., `mask-mode: luminance;` or `mask-mode: alpha;`).

## Fallback strategies
Baseline status for Masks: Newly available. It's been Baseline since 2023-12-07.
Supported by: Chrome 120 (Dec 2023), Edge 120 (Dec 2023), Firefox 53 (Apr 2017), and Safari 15.4 (Mar 2022).

If a browser does not support `mask-image` or the prefixed version:
- The element will display without the texture (clean and solid fill).
- Ensure the content is still readable without the texture (progressive enhancement).
- You can use a background image or an overlay as a fallback to simulate the texture, although it will not affect the transparency of the content itself.

```css
/* Fallback: Use a background image for browsers without mask support */
@supports (not (mask-image: url(x))) and (not (-webkit-mask-image: url(x))) {
  .weathered-element {
    /* Fallback adds texture on top or behind, depending on implementation */
    background-image: url('grunge-pattern.svg');
    background-color: #fff; /* Ensure background is solid if needed */
  }
}
```

# Same Document Transitions

## The Problem

Web sites often provide multiple views of an object, for instance a list of products, and then a detail page for each product. Navigating between the two views often feels disconnected. When a user clicks a product thumbnail to view its details, the thumbnail disappears and a new, larger image appears instantly elsewhere on the screen. This lack of continuity makes it harder for users to track relationships between elements.

## The Solution

The **View Transitions API** allows you to specify element pairs that exist in different states before and after a transition. When triggering a transition with `document.startViewTransition()` in a Single Page Navigation (SPA), the browser identifies these shared elements by their shared unique `view-transition-name`. It then automatically calculates the difference in their position, size, and styling, and animates them smoothly from the old state to the new state. This transition occurs in the top layer, above even elements with high `z-index` values.

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Wrap State Changes in `startViewTransition`

For Single-Page Applications (SPAs) or simple state changes, wrap the logic that updates the DOM in `document.startViewTransition`. The browser captures a snapshot of the current state, runs the update, and then captures the new state. 

```javascript
function navigate(view) {
  // MANDATORY: Wrap the update in startViewTransition
  document.startViewTransition(() => updateDOM(view));
}
```

### Step 2: Assign Shared Transition Names

Use the `view-transition-name` CSS property to tell the browser which elements should be morphed. The name can be anything (except `none`). **MANDATORY**: there must be no more than 1 element before and after with a given `view-transition-name`. If there are 2 or more elements with a given `view-transition-name`, the DOM will be updated to the new state immediately, without a transition.

You can use multiple `view-transition-name`s to morph multiple pairs of elements. For example, you may want to transition both the product image and title with separate transitions.

Because there are multiple items on the list view, you can not give the all of them the same `view-transition-name`. This can be solved in two ways in a SPA.

1. **Dynamic detail page:** Assign each item on the list page a unique `view-transition-name`, and then dynamically apply that name to the matching element on the detail page when the list item is selected, as shown here.

```css
/* In the list view, give each */
#product-1 { view-transition-name: p1 }
#product-2 { view-transition-name: p2 }
#product-3 { view-transition-name: p3 }
```

```js
function updateDOM(clickedTransitionName){
  const hero = document.getElementById("hero");
  hero.style.viewTransitionName = clickedTransitionName;
}
```

2. **Dynamic list item:** Assign the element on the detail page a `view-transition-name`, and apply that name to the item on the list page when it is selected. Remove the `view-transition-name` from the item on the list page when returning to the list page.

The `#hero` element on the detail page and the selected `.thumbnail` element on the list page share a `view-transition-name`. 

```css
#hero{
  view-transition-name: hero;
}
.thumbnail.selected {
  view-transition-name: hero;
}
```

When a thumbnail is clicked, we need to prepare the list view by assigning the `view-transition-name` using the `.selected` class selector, and making any changes to the DOM before starting the transition.

Then, you can call `document.startViewTransition()`, and apply the changes to transition the page from the detail to list view.

After navigating back to the list view, you must clean up the view transition classes to prevent the next navigation from erroring. You can perform this cleanup after the transition's `finished` promise resolves.

```javascript
// Function called when a thumbnail is clicked
function goFromListToDetail(e){
  e.currentTarget.classList.add("selected");
  const hero = document.getElementById("hero");
  const bgColor = getComputedStyle(e.currentTarget).backgroundColor;
  hero.style.background = bgColor;

  // Trigger the transition, checking for support
  if (!document.startViewTransition) {
    document.body.classList.add("detail");
    // MANDATORY Accessibility Routing: Route focus to the newly revealed heading to announce context and preserve logical tab flow
    document.getElementById("detail-heading")?.focus();
    return; // MANDATORY: End function execution if view transitions are not supported.  
  }
  const transition = document.startViewTransition(() => {
    document.body.classList.add("detail");
  });
  // MANDATORY Accessibility Routing: Route focus after the view transition resolves
  transition.finished.finally(() => {
    document.getElementById("detail-heading")?.focus();
  });
}

// Function called when navigating from detail back to list view
function goFromDetailToList() {
  if (!document.startViewTransition) {
    document.body.classList.remove("detail");
    document.getElementById("list-heading")?.focus();
    return;
  }
  const transition = document.startViewTransition(() => {
    document.body.classList.remove("detail");
  });
  // Clean up the list view and route focus
  transition.finished.finally(() => {
    // Route focus back to list view
    document.getElementById("list-heading")?.focus();
    // Remove selected classList to remove view-transition-names
    document.querySelectorAll(".selected").forEach(
      (element) => {
        element.classList.remove("selected");
      },
    );
  });
}
```

The method you choose will depend on the use case. The dynamic list item requires less repeated CSS, but more manual JavaScript cleanup.


### Step 3: Fix Aspect Ratio "Stretching"

By default, the browser cross-fades the old and new snapshots within a group that stretches to fit both. If you are transitioning text, set the width of the text element to `fit-content` on both the old and new views, so that the transitioned element's aspect ratio is stable.

```css
#list-page .title {
  width: fit-content;
}

#detail-page #title {
  width: fit-content;
}
```

If you are transitioning elements that change aspect ratio, you may need to set the height of the old and new pseudo-elements to 100% of the `::view-transition-pair()` pseudo-element.

```css
::view-transition-old(hero),
::view-transition-new(hero){
  height: 100%;
}
```

The pseudo-elements are snapshots of the live elements, so you can also use `object-fit` and `object-position` declarations for more control of the transitioning effect.

## Best Practices

-   **DO NOT** specify too many transitions. Only use shared elements for primary content that the user is actively tracking (e.g., hero images, headings).
-   **DO** remove temporary `view-transition-name` values after the transition finishes to avoid side effects on future transitions.
-   **DO NOT** transition elements with active animations. View transitions operate on snapshots, so any animations will appear to be paused during the view transition.
-   **DO** respect user preferences for reduced motion using the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query.
-   **MANDATORY Accessibility Routing**: View transitions morph page layouts dynamically but do not manage programmatic focus. If focus remains on an element that is hidden or removed during the transition, focus is abandoned, leaving keyboard and assistive technology users without context. Shift focus programmatically to an updated page heading or view container (using `tabindex="-1"`) immediately after the DOM updates or when the view transition's `finished` promise resolves.

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  ::view-transition-group(*),
  ::view-transition-old(*),
  ::view-transition-new(*) {
    animation: none !important;
  }
}
```

## Fallback Strategies

Baseline status for View transitions: Newly available. It's been Baseline since 2025-10-14.
Supported by: Chrome 111 (Mar 2023), Edge 111 (Mar 2023), Firefox 144 (Oct 2025), and Safari 18 (Sep 2024).

The View Transitions API is designed for progressive enhancement. Browsers that do not support it will simply execute the DOM update immediately without animation.

```javascript
function navigate(){
  if (!document.startViewTransition) {
    // Fallback: Just update the DOM
    updateDOM();
  } else {
    document.startViewTransition(() => updateDOM());
  }
}
```


--- Guide for scroll-entry-exit-effects ---
# Add entry and exit effects to elements as they enter or exit the scrollport

Entry and exit effects are animations that are triggered when an element enters or leaves the viewport. This can be used to create engaging and dynamic user experiences. For example, you can use an entry effect to fade in an element as it scrolls into view, or an exit effect to scale it down as it scrolls out of view.

## How to implement

To add entry and exit effects to an element, you need to combine a few CSS properties. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1.  **Create separate `@keyframes` for the entry and exit animations.** The entry animation will be applied as the element enters the viewport, and the exit animation will be applied as it leaves.

    ```css
    @keyframes slide-in {
      from { transform: translateX(-100%); }
    }
    @keyframes slide-out {
      to { transform: translateX(100%); }
    }
    ```

2.  **Attach the entry and exit keyframes to the element.** You can do this by defining multiple animations in the `animation` property.

    -   Give the entry animation an `animation-fill-mode` of `backwards` so that it applies its initial state before the animation starts.
    -   Give the exit animation an `animation-fill-mode` of `forwards` so that it maintains its final state after the animation is complete.

    ```css
    .animated-element {
      animation:
        slide-in 1s linear backwards,
        slide-out 1s linear forwards;
    }
    ```

3.  **Create a View Timeline and link it to the animations.** A View Timeline is a type of timeline that is linked to the visibility of an element in the viewport. You can create one using the `view()` function and then apply it to your animations using the `animation-timeline` property.

    ```css
    .animated-element {
      animation-timeline: view();
    }
    ```

    By default, `view()` tracks the element on the `block` axis. If you need to track it on the `inline` axis, you can use `view(inline)`.

4.  **Limit the animations to the `entry` and `exit` ranges.** The `animation-range` property allows you to specify which part of the timeline an animation should run on.

    -   The `entry` range covers the time from when the element first enters the viewport until it is fully visible.
    -   The `exit` range covers the time from when the element starts to leave the viewport until it is completely hidden.

    ```css
    .animated-element {
      animation-range: entry, exit;
    }
    ```

## Example code

This code animates the direct children of the scroller on scroll using an **anonymous view-timeline**:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  @supports ((animation-timeline: view()) and (animation-range: entry)) {
    @keyframes grow {
      from {
        scale: 0.5;
      }
    }
    @keyframes shrink {
      to {
        scale: 0.5;
      }
    }

    .scroller > * {
      animation:
        grow auto linear backwards,
        shrink auto linear forwards;
      animation-timeline: view(inline);
      animation-range: entry, exit;
    }
  }
}
```

As the elements enter the scrollport the `grow` animation is played, and as they leave the scrollport the `shrink` animation is played.

The following code has the same visual outcome, but animates the direct children of the scroller on scroll using an **named view-timeline**:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  @supports ((animation-timeline: view()) and (animation-range: entry)) {
    @keyframes grow {
      from {
        scale: 0.5;
      }
    }
    @keyframes shrink {
      to {
        scale: 0.5;
      }
    }

    .scroller > * {
      view-timeline: --tl inline;
      animation:
        grow auto linear backwards,
        shrink auto linear forwards;
      animation-timeline: --tl;
      animation-range: entry, exit;
    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

When using scroll-driven animations, it's important to follow a few best practices to ensure a smooth and accessible experience:

- **DO** include feature detection: Not all browsers support scroll-driven animations. Use `@supports ((animation-timeline: view()) and (animation-range: entry))` to check for support and provide a fallback for browsers that don't support it.

- **DO** use the correct declaration order: When using the `animation` shorthand property, declare `animation-timeline` *after* it to prevent the shorthand from resetting the timeline.

When using the `view()` function to create a scroll-driven animation:

- **OPTIONAL** be explicit about the axis to track: When not targeting the default `block` axis (such as in a horizontal scroller), be explicit about which axis to track with `view(block)` or `view(inline)`.
- When the animation is not applied to the tracked subject itself, use a named view timeline.

When using the `view-timeline` property to create a scroll-driven animation:

- **DO** use a CSS `<dashed-ident>` for the name.
- **OPTIONAL** be explicit about the axis to track: When not targeting the default `block` axis (such as in a horizontal scroller), be explicit about which axis to track with `view-timeline-axis`.
- **DO** make sure the scope of the lookup works: When the element that is declaring the `view-timeline` is not a flat tree ancestor of the animated element, hoist up the visibility of the `view-timeline`’s name by using `timeline-scope` on a shared ancestor.

Prefer a named `view-timeline` when multiple elements or children of the tracked subject need to animate.

## Browser support and fallback strategies

Scroll-driven animations has limited availability.
Supported by: Chrome 115 (Jul 2023), Edge 115 (Jul 2023), and Safari 26 (Sep 2025).
Unsupported in: Firefox.. Therefore, a fallback strategy is typically required.

For browsers that do not support scroll-driven animations, you can use a fallback to recreate the visual effects. The fallbacks are typically built with either a scroll listener (for ScrollTimeline effects) or the IntersectionObserver API (for ViewTimeline effects).

In browsers with built-in support for scroll-driven animations, ALWAYS use the native CSS implementation as those are more performant.

Note that not every effect can be recreated using the fallbacks approach.

For this use-case specifically, the following script applies the fallback for browsers that do not support scroll-driven animations. It uses an `IntersectionObserver` to track the visibility of the `.wrapper` element and updates the `transform` property of the layers based on the scroll position.

```html
<script>
  if (!CSS.supports('(animation-timeline: view()) and (animation-range: entry)')) {
    const observer = new IntersectionObserver(

# Shrinking headder on scroll

A shrinking header on scroll is a common UI pattern where a fixed header element at the top of the page smoothly transitions to a smaller size as the user scrolls down. This effect is often used to maximize screen real estate for the main content while keeping essential navigation or branding elements accessible. With CSS scroll-driven animations, this effect can be achieved in a declarative and performant way, by linking an animation to the scroll position of the document.

## How to implement

Here’s how to create a shrinking header on scroll:

1.  **Create a fixed header:** Start with a header element that is fixed to the top of the page and has a predefined height.

    ```html
    <header>HEADER</header>
    ```

    ```css
    header {
      position: fixed;
      height: 200px;
      top: 0;
      left: 0;
      right: 0;
    }
    ```

2.  **Define the shrink animation:** Create a CSS animation that changes the height of the header.

    ```css
    @keyframes shrink {
      to {
        height: 50px;
      }
    }
    ```

3.  **Apply the animation and scroll timeline:** Attach the animation to the header and use the `scroll()` function to link it to the document’s scroll position.

    ```css
    header {
      animation: shrink auto linear both;
      animation-timeline: scroll(block root);
    }
    ```

4.  **Set the `animation-range`:** Use the `animation-range` property to specify the scroll distance over which the animation should occur. For example, to shrink the header over the first 150 pixels of scrolling, you would use `animation-range: 0px 150px;`.

    ```css
    header {
      animation-range: 0px 150px;
    }
    ```

**Tip:** To prevent the content following the header from being obscured by it, add a `padding-top` to the `body` (or the main content container) that is equal to the initial height of the header.

**Tip:** To make sure the contents of the page scroll in sync with the shrinking header, set the `animation-range-end` to the difference between the start and end sizes. This ensures the animation completes precisely when the header reaches its final size. In this demo the header shrinks from `200px` to `50px`, so the `animation-range-end` is set to `150px`.

## Example code

```css
@keyframes shrink {
  to {
    height: 50px;
  }
}

header {
  animation: shrink auto linear both;
  animation-timeline: scroll(block root);
  animation-range: 0px 150px;
}
```

## Best Practices

When using scroll-driven animations, it's important to follow a few best practices to ensure a smooth and accessible experience:

- **DO** include feature detection: Not all browsers support scroll-driven animations. Use `@supports ((animation-timeline: scroll()) and (animation-range: 0% 100%))` to check for support and provide a fallback for browsers that don't support it.
  - The `(animation-range: 0% 100%)` check **MUST** be included here, to filter out browsers with only partial support.
  - **DO NOT** use the `scroll-timeline-polyfill` package for the fallback strategy as it is not feature complete and has a lot of known issues.
  - If the animation is only considered to be decorative, opt for Progressive Enhancement and **DO NOT** provide a fallback.
- **DO** respect user preferences: Some users prefer to have less motion on the web. Use the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query to disable or reduce your animations for these users.
- **DO** try to animate only performant CSS properties: For the smoothest animations, stick to animating properties that can be handled by the browser's compositor thread, such as `transform` and `opacity`. Animating other properties like `width` or `height` can lead to performance issues.
- **DO** use the correct declaration order: When using the `animation` shorthand property, declare `animation-timeline` and `animation-range` *after* it to prevent the shorthand from resetting the timeline.

When using the `scroll()` function to create a scroll-driven animation:

- **OPTIONAL** be explicit about the scroller: When not targeting the nearest ancestor scroller, be explicit about which scroller you want to use with `scroll(root)` or `scroll(self)`.
  - When `root`, `nearest`, or `self` are not sufficient, use a named scroll-timeline.
- **OPTIONAL** be explicit about the axis to track: When not targeting the default `block` axis (such as in a horizontal scroller), be explicit about which axis to track with `scroll(block)` or `scroll(inline)`.

As for this use case specifically:

- The element that you animate **MUST** not be `position: static` or `position: relative` when using percentages in the `animation-range`.
  - This is because those elements are considered “in-flow”. Shrinking those elements as you scroll, would shrink the total scroll distance, thereby affecting the computed value of — for example — `10%` into the scroll.

## Browser support and fallback strategies

Scroll-driven animations has limited availability.
Supported by: Chrome 115 (Jul 2023), Edge 115 (Jul 2023), and Safari 26 (Sep 2025).
Unsupported in: Firefox.. Therefore, a fallback strategy is typically required.

For browsers that do not support scroll-driven animations, you can use a fallback to recreate the visual effects. The fallbacks are typically built with either a scroll listener (for ScrollTimeline effects) or the IntersectionObserver API (for ViewTimeline effects).

In browsers with built-in support for scroll-driven animations, ALWAYS use the native CSS implementation as those are more performant.

Note that not every effect can be recreated using the fallbacks approach.

For this use-case specifically, the following script applies the fallback for browsers that do not support scroll-driven animations. It uses a scroll listener to track the scroll position of the document over a distance of `150px` and updates the header's height accordingly.

```js
// Fallback for browsers that don't support scroll-driven animations
if (!CSS.supports('(animation-timeline: scroll()) and (animation-range: 0% 100%)')) {
  const header = document.querySelector('header');

  const initialHeight = 200;
  const finalHeight = 50;
  const scrollDistance = 150;

  window.addEventListener('scroll', () => {
    const scrollY = window.scrollY;
    const scrollPercent = Math.min(1, scrollY / scrollDistance);
    const newHeight = initialHeight - (initialHeight - finalHeight) * scrollPercent;

    header.style.height = `${newHeight}px`;
  });
}
```


--- Guide for soft-edge-content-fade ---
## Overview
To apply a transparency gradient to the edges of a container (e.g., to indicate more content is available to scroll or to fade out text), use CSS Masking with a linear gradient. This approach is superior to using a semi-transparent overlay because it actually fades the content itself, allowing the background to show through naturally without interfering with text selection or pointer events.

## Implementation
To implement a soft edge fade:

### Fading the bottom edge of a container
This is useful for indicating that there is more content below in a scrollable area.

```css
.container {
  /* Enable scrolling */
  overflow-y: auto;
  
  /* MANDATORY: Use vendor prefix for wider support in older browsers */
  -webkit-mask-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, black 80%, transparent 100%);
  
  /* Standard property for modern browsers */
  mask-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, black 80%, transparent 100%);
}
```

### Fading both top and bottom edges
You can use a single gradient with multiple color stops to fade both edges.

```css
.dual-fade-container {
  /* Content is visible between 10% and 90% of the height */
  -webkit-mask-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent 0%, black 10%, black 90%, transparent 100%);
  mask-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent 0%, black 10%, black 90%, transparent 100%);
}
```

## Fallback strategies
Baseline status for Masks: Newly available. It's been Baseline since 2023-12-07.
Supported by: Chrome 120 (Dec 2023), Edge 120 (Dec 2023), Firefox 53 (Apr 2017), and Safari 15.4 (Mar 2022).

If a browser does not support `mask-image` or the prefixed version:
- The content will not fade and will display with sharp edges.
- Ensure the interface is still functional and content is readable without the fade (progressive enhancement).
- You can use a semi-transparent overlay as a fallback, but be aware it requires knowing the background color and may interfere with text selection unless `pointer-events: none` is used.

```css
/* Fallback using an overlay for browsers that do not support masking */
@supports (not (mask-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, black, transparent))) and (not (-webkit-mask-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, black, transparent))) {
  .container {
    position: relative;
  }
  
  .container::after {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    height: 20%;
    /* Fallback assumes a solid background color (e.g., white) */
    background: linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(255,255,255,0), rgba(255,255,255,1));
    pointer-events: none; /* Allow interaction with text underneath */
  }
}
```
